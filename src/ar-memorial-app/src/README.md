# AR Memorial App

## Overview
The AR Memorial App is a cutting-edge application that integrates Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and various interactive features to create a unique memorial experience. This project leverages modern web technologies, including React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Features
- **Augmented Reality Integration**: View 3D models in AR using Model-Viewer.
- **AI Elements**: Suggestion system for user input and optional integration with external AI services.
- **Hologram Layers**: Render holographic layers using Three.js or Model-Viewer.
- **Movement Scripts**: Trigger animations for different avatar types (male, female, child).
- **NFC Features**: Read and interact with NFC tags.
- **NFT Token Placeholders**: Generate QR codes for NFT metadata links.
- **GPS Tag Options**: Integrate GPS functionality using Leaflet.js or Google Maps API.
- **VR Integration**: Manage VR compatibility and rendering for VR headsets.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ar-memorial-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash

   ```

## Development
- The application is structured into several directories:
  - `src/ai`: Contains AI logic and functions.
  - `src/ar`: Includes AR components and movement scripts.
  - `src/components`: Houses reusable components like NFC Reader and NFT Token Placeholder.
  - `src/hooks`: Custom hooks for hardware management.
  - `src/server`: Backend server setup and API routes.
  - `src/styles`: Tailwind CSS styles for the application.
  - `src/tests`: Unit tests for both AR and server functionalities.

## Testing
- To run tests, use:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

## Hardware Requirements
- NFC Reader: Required for NFC functionalities.
- GPS Module: Required for GPS-related features.
- VR Headset: Optional for VR integration.

## Deliverables
- AR integration with hologram layers.
- AI suggestion system.
- NFC and GPS functionalities.
- NFT token placeholders with QR code generation.
- VR compatibility and rendering support.
